## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2022-06-22

## Changed

- Upgrade upstream chart from 0.33.0 to [0.48.5](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/releases/tag/loki-distributed-0.48.5)
- Upgrade Loki from 2.2.1 to [2.5.0](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases/tag/v2.5.0)
- **Breaking**: Upgrade requires manual intervention.

### Changes required in your `values.yaml` file:
- now `ruler`, `distributor` and `queryFrontend` require access to the object storage.
- storage config is more similar to loki config file, and is done on `loki.schemaConfig` and `loki.storageConfig`.
- data format has not changed, so as long as you keep the same schema version and storage setup, you can upgrade/rollback with no data loss.
- feel free to ask us if you need help regarding your specific setup.

###Â Upgrade procedure
1. create your updated `values.yaml` file.
2. in `happa`, update loki version.
3. in `happa`, replace values with your updated `values.yaml` file.

Notes:
* during upgrade, log histogram can be inconsistent. This only impacts log histogram, and only during upgrade.
* In case of rollback, logs times may be wrong because latest loki version adjusts timestamps.
